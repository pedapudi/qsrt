# QSRT agent guide

This repository builds and validates `Kimi-K3-QSRT`, a TP-independent hybrid
checkpoint whose first qualified serving target is TP12.
QSRT experts use SQG-E4M3 trellis reconstruction with expert-static K2/K4 rate
shifts around K3. The high-quality tier uses X4T, which reproduces the official
MXFP4 tensors exactly while compressing their scale plane. Non-expert linears
come from the reusable offline MXFP8 overlay.

The canonical name is **QSRT**: Quantile-Stratified Rate-shifted Trellis codec.
Do not introduce TrellisShift, TSH, SQRT-C, `mixed_exl3`, or generic X4 names in
new code, schemas, artifacts, or documentation. `X4T` is the only current X4
format. MCG and MUL1 may remain only where they are active numerical controls
or external EXL encoder APIs.

## Current state (2026-08-07)

- Kimi-K3 has 93 decoder layers. Layers 1-92 contain 896 routed experts each,
  for 82,432 layer/expert assignments.
- `/models/Kimi-K3-EXL3-3p09` and its serve directory remain the validated
  interim teacher and comparison checkpoint. They are not the QSRT format.
- QSRT storage is tensor-parallel independent. The canonical Kimi container is
  atom-major and never serializes a TP count or rank ownership. TP12 remains
  the first qualified serving target and the current performance gate, but
  candidate generation, allocation, capture, storage, and byte accounting must
  not depend on it. Direct-load serving views own complete balanced atoms;
  prepared rank-local tensors are disposable load caches, never checkpoint
  shards.
- The lossy search is `R0/R1/R2`, with one `r13` decision shared by `w1` and
  `w3` and an independent `r2` decision for `w2`.
- `qsrt_sqg_e4m3` is the primary and sole runtime encoding profile. Its
  `sqg_xor_cheb_t12` codebook composes the carry-mixed bijective SQG graph
  with the 4,096-byte modal T12 approximation
  to the Chebyshev-derived finite-E4M3 staircase. K2/K3/K4 use one graph
  construction and one scalar law; rate changes only the history/branch split.
  QSRT generates the complete direct encoder labels internally and freezes
  SHA-256 identities for the T12 table and all three rate tables against B12X.
  `sqg-normal-e4m3` and the exact profile-5 mappings remain offline controls
  only; they are not valid materialized runtime profiles.
- The sealed `sqg_xor_cheb_t12` candidate pool is at
  `/data/models/Kimi-K3-QSRT-SQG-XOR-CHEB-T12-CANDIDATES-v1`. It contains all
  92 MoE layers and 82,432 experts. The confirmation gate retained a nonzero
  rate shift for 9,379 experts (11.38%); `w2` selected R1+ for 11.11%, coupled
  `w13` selected R1+ for 8.66%, and at least one axis selected R2 for 8.38%.
  K2 uses the native four-stratum graph. There is no alternate K2 labelling.
- X4T is the exact endpoint. There is no raw-MXFP4 or old variable-rate X4 tier
  in a QSRT artifact.
- X4T promotion remains a whole-expert decision. The rejected matrix-granular
  and conditional-restoration selectors are not part of the repository or
  production workflow.
- The earlier layer-global dense `H2` study was invalid as a production metric:
  post-SiTU coordinate indices are expert-local. Layer-global `H13` is valid,
  but `H2` must be built from expert-stratified routed rows and shrunk toward
  identity. Unsupported experts fall back to identity.
- The source-controlled 1,000,000-token training capture is complete at
  `/data/datasets/kquant/captures/k3-denseh-broad-v6-1m-train.kqcapture` (298 GiB,
  1,226 documents, zero dropped rows). It is the first scale-up from the
  65,536-token pilot, not the final corpus. Mode-selection and final-validation
  captures must remain document- and prompt-disjoint.
- Its reusable `H13`/identity-prior bundle is
  `/data/datasets/kquant/hessians/k3-denseh-broad-v6-1m-train-h13-identity-v1.kqhess`;
  the layer-indexed route/input cache is
  `/data/datasets/kquant/captures/k3-denseh-broad-v6-1m-train-input-v1.kqsamples`.
  On this host they build in about 9 and 13 seconds respectively once the raw
  capture is available.
- The offline SQG tile encoder now uses predecessor-major E4M3 label loads,
  packed K2 traceback, rate-specific launch widths/cache carveouts, and packed
  half2 comparisons. At full `C128`, a 512-tile SM120 benchmark improved from
  7.270/6.378/6.054 ms to 4.825/4.015/3.345 ms at K2/K3/K4. Sixty-three
  old/new comparisons spanning K2/K3/K4, C1/C32/C128, three input families,
  and production/control LUTs were bit-exact; the full 374-test suite passed.
  A layer-24, 20-expert, production-shaped endpoint run fell from about 136 to
  89 seconds and emitted the same candidate-payload SHA-256 as the preceding
  C128 implementation. That run qualified the encoder optimization but does
  not make its profile-5 payload reusable by `sqg_xor_cheb_t12`.
- `C32` remains a research-only screening context. On the initial 20-expert
  comparison it put every C128 confirmation winner in its top three, but that
  evidence is not broad enough to change production policy. Candidate
  construction and final selection for the next pool remain full `C128`.
- Current candidate construction keeps `h2_reverse` neuron ordering, rotation
  draw zero, and `folded_scale_power=0`. On the 24-expert production panel,
  identity, energy-balanced, and stratified-energy-balanced permutations lost to
  `h2_reverse`; every tested nonzero folded-scale strength (`0.25`, `0.5`,
  `1.0`) also increased routed validation SSE. Keep those alternatives as
  research controls rather than silently enabling them in production.
- The first qualified all-QSRT high-rate profile is a fixed 3.083333-bpw
  schedule with 22 complete K3 records and two complete K4 records. On the
  24-expert document-disjoint confirmation panel it reduced pooled SSE by
  11.907% from uniform K3 and slightly beat tile-local top-two-K4 funding on
  gate/up, down, and both axes. It therefore needs no tile selector or
  channel-dependent funding grammar. The complete 4M-backed candidate pool is
  sealed at
  `/data/models/Kimi-K3-QSRT-SQG-XOR-CHEB-T12-3p08-CANDIDATES-v1`.
  Its canonical TP-independent 92-layer materialization is sealed at
  `/data/models/Kimi-K3-QSRT-SQG-XOR-CHEB-T12-3p08-v2`. It uses the
  `atoms_v2` revision of the same 96-row atom-major container: each row groups
  its P33 expert bundles followed by its P43 expert bundles and serializes no
  TP count.
- Build `sqg_xor_cheb_t12` only into a fresh candidate pool. Do not resume or mix the
  profile-ID-5 or R44 candidate shards into the new artifact; changing the
  graph changes the Viterbi paths and requires full re-encoding.

The complete design is documented in
[docs/qsrt-technical-brief.md](docs/qsrt-technical-brief.md). The uniform
two-bit representation is defined independently in
[docs/qsrt-2bpw-codec.md](docs/qsrt-2bpw-codec.md).

## Porting QSRT to another gated MoE model

Treat a model such as GLM 5.2 as a new codec port, not as a Kimi checkpoint
with renamed dimensions. Do not write payloads until the following contracts
are explicit and tested.

### 1. Freeze source and architecture identity

Pin the repository/model ID, immutable revision, tokenizer/chat template,
configuration, source tensor index, and every source shard hash. Inventory:

- decoder and MoE layer counts;
- routed and shared expert counts, top-k routing, gate normalization, and any
  expert grouping;
- exact gate/up/down tensor names, stored orientations, dtypes, block scales,
  and logical matrix shapes;
- activation equation and the location of multiplicative gates;
- tensor-parallel sharding axes and local dimensions at the intended TP;
- non-expert linears and their serving format; and
- the source checkpoint's exact high-quality representation.

Add a model-specific constants/adapter module and header-only inventory tests.
Never infer matrix roles merely from a familiar tensor suffix.

### 2. Prove the hidden-coordinate symmetry

QSRT's shared neuron permutation is valid only when the expert's nonlinear
middle operation is coordinatewise and the same permutation is applied to all
coupled branches. Write the model's expert function and prove the exact update,
for example

```text
W_gate' = P W_gate
W_up'   = P W_up
W_down' = W_down P^T.
```

Test full-precision closure on real source experts before quantization. A
Hadamard, sign transform, affine scale, cross-channel normalization, or
model-specific interaction does not inherit this proof. Document where every
encoder transform is cancelled relative to the activation.

### 3. Derive a model-native fixed payload

Choose logical record width, coding-tile width, pair/super-record structure,
and TP ownership from the new intermediate dimension and target GPU MMA atoms.
The general fixed-rate identity is

```text
K_donor + K_recipient = 2 * K_baseline.
```

For Kimi v1 this is P24 versus P33 over paired 128-channel records. Another
model may need a different record width or rank grouping. Prove divisibility,
constant stride, exact bytes, rank balance, bounded random access, and malformed
input rejection before freezing a format. Do not copy Kimi's 24-record mode
table when the new intermediate axis has different geometry.

### 4. Establish the reconstruction law

Select `L`, supported rates, reference distribution, SQG rank permutation, and
finite reconstruction type. Verify graph bijection, one outgoing edge per
stratum, all-rank coverage, finite labels, tail-biting closure, and exact
pack/unpack. Train or synthesize the scalar law on the production transformed
and BlockLDLQ-feedback domain. A source checkpoint's scalar alphabet is not
automatically the optimal reconstruction alphabet for the second codec.

### 5. Build a representative resident teacher

The resident checkpoint must fit at the target TP and expose exact routes,
applied gates, expert inputs, and canonical post-activation rows. The immutable
official checkpoint remains the offline weight source. Assemble source-pinned,
document-disjoint training, selection, and final-validation plans with prose,
dialogue, code, math, multilingual, tools, and realistic long-context traffic.

Run a route census first. Allocate expert-aware row reservoirs, preserve sample
probabilities, and record distinct-document support. `H13` may be shared only
when its input basis is actually shared; `H2` is expert-local. Define shrinkage
and identity fallback before encoding all experts.

### 6. Port the source decoder and candidate encoder

Implement bit-exact source tensor decoding and round-trip tests. Stream one
expert or bounded expert batch at a time; never materialize the full official
model on CPU or GPU. For every expert, emit uniform baseline and allowed
rate-shift candidates, preserve dense-H BlockLDLQ feedback, reconstruct the
complete expert function, and select modes with paired document evidence.
Candidate generation must be allocation-independent and resumable by atomic
layer.

### 7. Define the high-quality endpoint

X4T is specific to an MXFP4 nibble plus UE8M0-scale source. Reuse it only if
the new model has the same exact source contract. Otherwise design a separate
endpoint that either reproduces the source tensor exactly or has an explicitly
validated near-lossless error target. Build an all-expert exact-byte index;
never allocate from nominal bpw alone.

### 8. Implement the target runtime

Add reference CPU decode first, then the model's target-TP B12X and vLLM paths.
Prove layout, TP joins, transform order, A16 numerical closure, graph replay,
register/shared-memory bounds, rank-tail latency, and routed fused-MoE
performance. A decoder microbenchmark is insufficient if activation conversion,
scale preparation, or expert scheduling erases the gain.

### 9. Allocate and release

Score candidates on untouched natural-routing data, solve the global
quality-versus-exact-byte allocation, and materialize only into fresh artifact
and serve directories. Require structural and bit-exact validation, streamed
source comparison, live-routing drift, teacher-logit/KLD, task quality, and
production latency before calling `<Model>-QSRT` usable.

Keep model-specific dimensions, source formats, schema IDs, and kernel support
out of the shared QSRT theory. A successful new-model port should add a small
adapter and explicit format version, not weaken Kimi-K3's frozen codec contract.

## Repository boundaries

- Quantization, capture analysis, allocation, packaging, and correctness tools
  live here.
- Production serving changes live in `/home/luke/projects/vllm`.
- B12X kernels live in `/home/luke/projects/b12x`.
- The QSRT offline encoder lives in `qsrt/exl3_encoder_backend.py`; its
  tail-biting SQG CUDA code lives under `qsrt/csrc`. The checkout at
  `/home/luke/projects/exllamav3` must remain an unmodified upstream dependency
  and supplies only its extension plus Hadamard/tensor utilities. Put every
  QSRT-specific encoder change in this repository.
- Never stage sibling-repository changes in a QSRT commit.
- Use `.venv/bin/python` and `.venv/bin/pytest`.
- Never commit checkpoint payloads, captures, generated traces, `out/`,
  `__pycache__`, or `*.pyc`.
- Treat `/models`, `/data/datasets/kquant`, and `/data/kquant` artifacts as
  valuable. Store reusable corpora, captures, and Hessians under
  `/data/datasets/kquant`; store derived experiments under `/data/kquant`. Use a
  fresh path for every changed corpus, Hessian policy, codebook, allocation, or
  encoder build.
- Candidate layers are atomic and an identical all-layer build is resumable.
  Never mix settings in an existing destination.
- Before a 12-GPU run, verify GPU enumeration, free memory, host RAM/swap,
  destination capacity, and exact worker PIDs. Do not kill by broad name match.

## Current QSRT pipeline

### 1. Validate the official source

The official checkpoint is an offline weight source; it is never loaded as the
resident calibration model.

```bash
cd /home/luke/projects/qsrt
uv sync --dev

.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from qsrt.io.hf_cache import resolve

checkpoint = resolve()
assert not checkpoint.missing_shards, checkpoint.missing_shards
assert len(checkpoint.shard_paths) == 96
assert len(checkpoint.complete_moe_layers()) == 92
print(checkpoint.snapshot_dir)
PY
```

### 2. Plan and capture the corpus

Build source-controlled JSONL plans, validate raw-record and post-tokenization
separation, then drive the resident interim checkpoint with
`scripts/run_interim_calibration_corpus.py`. Use fresh capture/report paths.
The immediate training target is 1,000,000 prompt tokens.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_calibration_corpus_plans.py \
  <training-report> <selection-report> <final-validation-report> \
  --output out/qsrt-corpus-integrity.json
```

The vLLM launcher must set `K3_QSRT_CAPTURE_DIR` and use the interim EXL3
teacher. Finalize the capture exactly once and reject any dropped sample rows,
TP join mismatch, epoch-zero probe contamination, or document overlap.

### 3. Reduce the capture once

Do not let every candidate worker rescan the raw routed capture. Build the valid
layer-global `H13` matrices in one tensor-selective GPU pass and repack the
rank-zero route/input rows into directly addressable layer files. The bundle
stores only a symbolic identity fallback for `H2`. For every supported expert,
the encoder reconstructs each decoded `r13` candidate, builds
`H2[e,r13]` just in time from its post-SiTU rows, shrinks it only toward
`trace(H2[e,r13]) / 3072 * I`, and discards it after encoding. A pooled
layer-global post-SiTU covariance must never enter this calculation.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_qsrt_hessians.py \
  <training-capture> <fresh-kqhess> \
  --device cuda:0 --request-step-min 1

.venv/bin/python scripts/build_qsrt_sample_cache.py \
  <training-capture> <fresh-layer-sample-cache>
```

The sample cache intentionally excludes TP-sharded teacher-middle rows. Do not
pool those rows into a layer-global `H2`; intermediate coordinates are
expert-local.

### 4. Build and seal all-expert candidates

Candidate generation streams official MXFP4 matrices one expert batch at a
time. It must use the new capture, the validated Hessian bundle, separate
`r13/r2` selection, and only R0/R1/R2.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/pack_qsrt_candidates.py \
  --dest <fresh-candidate-pool> \
  --capture <training-capture> \
  --sample-cache <layer-sample-cache> \
  --training-report <training-report> \
  --hessians <validated-kqhess> \
  --hessian-policy captured_blend \
  --mode-ids 0,1,2 \
  --codebook sqg_xor_cheb_t12 \
  --layout qsrt_guarded_reuse \
  --permutation-policy h2_reverse \
  --folded-scale-power 0 \
  --ldlq-tf32

.venv/bin/python scripts/finalize_qsrt_candidate_pool.py \
  <fresh-candidate-pool> --jobs 12
```

Do not use `captured_blend` until the bundle and candidate path prove that
`H2` is expert-stratified. Identity H is the scientific control, not a silent
fallback for a malformed dense-H bundle.

### 5. Score untouched validation data

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/score_qsrt_validation.py \
  --candidate-pool <candidate-pool> \
  --validation-capture <validation-capture> \
  --validation-report <validation-report> \
  --dest <validation-scores>

.venv/bin/python scripts/score_qsrt_mode_validation.py \
  --candidate-pool <candidate-pool> \
  --validation-scores <validation-scores> \
  --dest <mode-validation-scores>
```

The candidate pool's fit/confirmation folds select expert-static rate shifts.
The untouched capture estimates keep-tier damage and verifies each accepted
shift against its R0/R0 counterfactual. Final validation cannot tune modes,
codebooks, margins, or the X4T allocation.

### 6. Index X4T and allocate exact bytes

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/index_x4t_costs.py \
  --dest <x4t-cost-index> --jobs 12 --resume

.venv/bin/python scripts/allocate_qsrt.py \
  --candidate-pool <candidate-pool> \
  --validation-scores <validation-scores> \
  --x4t-cost-index <x4t-cost-index> \
  --target-container-bytes 1058586247168 \
  --output <allocation.json>
```

The allocator chooses between each expert's selected fixed-rate QSRT candidate
and its exact X4T byte cost. R0/R1/R2 are rate-shift decisions at constant
three-bit trellis payload; they are not the high-tier allocation.

### 6. Materialize, package, and validate

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/materialize_qsrt.py \
  --candidate-pool <candidate-pool> \
  --x4t-cost-index <x4t-cost-index> \
  --allocation <allocation.json> \
  --dest <fresh-artifact> --resume

.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_qsrt_artifact.py \
  --artifact <fresh-artifact> \
  --verify-payloads \
  --output out/validate-qsrt.json
```

Every materialized layer is a canonical QSRT atom file plus an exact X4T
layer file. Validation must close schemas, hashes, byte accounting, zero
padding, format tables, candidate bytes, and official MXFP4 reconstruction.
Serving builds a disposable rank-local preparation cache from these files; it
does not package another checkpoint or change canonical ownership.

### 7. Quality and runtime gates

Run the TP12 B12X numerical closures, X4T W4A16 closure, performance gate,
streamed PyTorch comparison, vLLM A16 compatibility path, KLD suite, live
routing drift checks, and task evaluations. A8 is a separate speed/quality
tradeoff and must not be used to judge the codec's weight distortion.

The fixed ` Berlin` prompt is a wiring smoke test only. A usable checkpoint
requires document-disjoint KLD and task quality plus production TP12 latency.

## Tests

Run the full CPU/unit suite for every code change:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

For artifact, source-loading, sharding, X4T, QSRT layout, or kernel changes,
also run the smallest relevant real-data or CUDA closure. Unit tests do not
establish full-model or production-kernel correctness.
